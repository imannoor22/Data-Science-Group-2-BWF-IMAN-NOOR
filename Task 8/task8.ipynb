    "\n",
    "- Designed to manage `train schedules`, `book tickets` and `view passenger details`. \n",
    "- It leverages Python's built-in `data structures` and `file handling` capabilities for efficient data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Structures\n",
    "2. File Handling\n",
    "3. Functions\n",
    "4. User Interface\n",

    "### **Dictionary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Train Information:**\n",
    "    The `trains` dictionary stores details about each train. The train ID is the key, and the value is another dictionary containing attributes like train name, source, destination and the number of available seats.\n",
    "- **Passenger Information:**   \n",
    "    The `passengers` dictionary holds passenger details. The passenger ID is the key, and the value is a tuple containing the passenger's name and the train ID they are booked on.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### **Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sets are used to store unique routes (`source-destination` pairs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tuple**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples store immutable passenger information. Since passenger details (`name and train ID`) should remain unchanged once booked, tuples are appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **List**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists maintain the order of train additions and other operations where order is important.\n",
    "- A list keeps track of the sequence in which trains were added.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **File Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "- File handling is done that ensures that train and passenger data are saved persistently. Data is loaded from files when the system starts and saved back to files when changes are made or the system exits."
