# Task 2: Git and GitHub

This repository contains my work for Task 2 of the internship.

## Task Description
Task 2 involved setting up a GitHub account, creating a public repository, and learning how to use Git and GitHub together. The main objective was to understand the basics of version control and collaborative development using these tools.

## Additional Notes
- Reflecting on Task 2, the process of creating a GitHub repository was straightforward, and it provided a foundational understanding of version control systems.
- Future tasks will likely involve using Git commands to manage and collaborate on projects effectively.
