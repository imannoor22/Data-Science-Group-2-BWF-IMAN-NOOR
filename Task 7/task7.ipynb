    "## **OOP in Python:**\n",
    "The *main concept* of object-oriented Programming (OOPs) or oops concepts in Python is *to bind the data and the functions that work together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A class is a collection of objects. \n",
    "- A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created.\n",

    "### **Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it.\n",

    "### **Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.\n",
    "- **Types of Inheritance:**\n",
    "    - **Single Inheritance:** Single-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit characteristics from a single-parent class.\n",
    "    - **Multilevel Inheritance:** Multi-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from an immediate parent class which in turn inherits properties from his parent class. \n",
    "    - **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Hierarchical-level inheritance enables more than one derived class to inherit properties from a parent class.\n",
    "    - **Multiple Inheritance:** Multiple-level inheritance enables one derived class to inherit properties from more than one base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polymorphism simply means having many forms.\n",
